# Causal evidence for frontal cortex organization related to perceptual decision-making

Data and code for paper titled "Causal evidence for frontal cortex organization related to perceptual decision-making", currently in submission.

Most of the analyses are written in MATLAB. Here is a guideline to the files:

MAIN TMS ANALYSES
- these are in analyze_results.m
- the file above loads the behavioral data (.mat files) located in the folder "Data"
- helper functions are located in the folder "helperFunctions"
- weights that come from the fMRI behavioral data (day 2 of the experiment) are computed in the folder "fmriDataAndAnalyses"

MIXED-EFFECTS MODELS
- these are done in R
- find the files in the folder "R mixed-effects analysis"
- the Excel sheets with data are generated by analyze_results.m

fMRI ROI ANALYSES
- these are included in the folder "fMRI_ROI_analyses"

MODELING
- main file is run_simulation.m in the folder "Modeling"
